This folder is meant to contain all libraries and other
files necessary for running the workflow. These are libraries that are specific
to this workflow and not the shared libraries or reference files,
which can be nominated by specifying
    /shared/lib/xxx, or /shared/reference/yyy.
Note that the Rakeiora portal and the sandbox are firewalled off
from the Internet, so your workflow will not be able to
programmatically download data from Internet websites as part of the run.
